        What Is Cryptocurrency?
    </h1>
            <h2> Cryptocurrency takes everything about traditional currency and turns it on its head. <br>It's a digital currency powered by cryptography, a built-in security feature that<br> makes it difficult (if not impossible) to counterfeit, with most operating <br>through blockchain technology.</h2>
            <h3>
                How Does Cryptocurrency Work?
            </h3>
            <h4>
                In the 1990s, everyone was talking about how to build the first decentralized currency <br>
                system that could transcend traditional financial institutions, be above complications such<br>
                 as exchange rates, and remain immune to organizational interference (i.e., governments, for example).<br>
                  The first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was created by Satoshi Nakamoto in the pursuit of decentralizing <br>
                  the financial system. There's no central bank or authority, and all transactions are maintained through<br>
                   a disparate network of computers that manage the records. The cryptocurrency market works like this.<br>
                    You purchase a "token" from your cryptocurrency of choice and use it to buy things online.<br>
                     There's no need to worry about exchange rates because the work is done for you. <br>
                     By switching to bitcoin cash, you're able to make transactions online safely. <br>
                     The tokens represent entries in a public ledger. The entries use encryption methods like public key <br>
                     and private key pairs or hashing functions. Bitcoin retains the lion's share of the market, <br>
                     but other "altcoins" 
                (Ethereum, litecoin, ripple/xrp, monero) are getting more popular.

    <h1> Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, a virtual currency designed to act as money and a form of payment outside the control of <br>any one person, group, or entity, and thus removing the need for third-party involvement in financial transactions.<br>
        Bitcoin  is a decentralized digital currency that can be transferred on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network.<br>
         Bitcoin transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger<br>
          called a blockchain. The cryptocurrency was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the <br>
          name Satoshi Nakamoto. The currency began use in 2009, when its implementation was released as open-source <br>
          software. <br>
          Bitcoin has been described as an economic bubble by at least eight Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences recipients.<br>
        
        The word bitcoin was defined in a white paper published on 31 October 2008. It is a compound of the words bit and coin.</h1>

    <h1>Dogecoin (/ˈdoʊ(d)ʒkɔɪn/ DOHJ-koyn or DOHZH-koyn Abbreviation: DOGE;  is a cryptocurrency created by software engineers 
        Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, who decided to create a payment system as a "joke", making fun of the wild speculation
         in cryptocurrencies at the time.[3] It is considered both the first "meme coin", and, more specifically, the first 
         "dog coin". Despite its satirical nature, some consider it a legitimate investment prospect. Dogecoin features the 
         face of the Shiba Inu dog from the "doge" meme as its logo and namesake. It was introduced on December 6, 
         2013, and quickly developed its own online community, reaching a market capitalization of over $85 billion on May 5,
          2021. It is the current shirt sponsorof Watford Football Club.</h1>

        Ethereum was conceived in 2013 by programmer Vitalik Buterin Additional founders of Ethereum included <br>
        Gavin Wood, Charles Hoskinson, Anthony Di Iorio and Joseph Lubin.In 2014, development work began and was crowdfunded,<br>
